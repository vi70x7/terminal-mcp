# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.35] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **`terminal_extra` meta-tool**: Convenience tools (`terminal_run_paged`, `terminal_retry`, `terminal_diff`, `terminal_resize`, `terminal_send_key`, `terminal_get_history`, `terminal_write_file`) are now collected behind a single lightweight meta-tool by default, reducing tool definition token overhead by ~50%. The agent can discover schemas via `list: true` and call any extra tool through `terminal_extra`.
- **`SMART_TERMINAL_DISABLED_TOOLS` env var**: Customize which tools are moved behind `terminal_extra`. Set to empty string to register all 15 tools with full schemas.

### Changed
- Stripped redundant `.describe()` calls from tool parameter schemas where the parameter name is self-documenting (e.g. `sessionId`, `command`, `cwd`, `timeout`). Keeps only 6 essential descriptions for non-obvious parameters.

### Fixed
- Fixed `pty-session` to properly track pending markers and allow smooth interruption of background commands.
- Handled `/mcp` POST parsing and transport errors gracefully in `http-scan-server` to avoid crashes.
- Fixed `terminal_start` test that expected auto-detect hint when no shell was explicitly provided.

## [1.2.12] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Implemented a session manager with shell detection and robust CWD (Current Working Directory) validation.
- Added a robust command runner utility with output parsing, limits, timeouts, and success checks.

### Changed
- Stripped ANSI sequences, carriage-return animations, and control characters from PTY output to save tokens and improve readability for AI models.
- Added handling for C1 8-bit OSC sequences (`0x9D`) in ANSI stripping.
- Processed erase-in-line (EL) sequences before ANSI stripping to properly truncate lines and prevent partial character overwrites.

### Fixed
- Fixed a sentinel leak where standalone `ERASE_EOL` sequences appearing without a preceding carriage return were missed.

## [1.2.11] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- Improved CWD validation and startup error handling for the `terminal_start` tool.

## [1.2.10] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Added `successExitCode` and `successFilePattern` checks to the `terminal_run` tool to assert successful execution.
